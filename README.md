# Wine_beer_sales_forecastForecast Wine and Beer Sales(10.01.2020)

The purpose of this project is to create a forecast for beers and wine for a year ahead. The project uses machine learning to create the best model to fit the data on the train set so that we can evaluate it against the test set. Once the model proves to be confident I proceed to make the forecast on the entire data set.
